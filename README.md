## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS (READ FIRST)

This README defines **minimum functional requirements**, not design limits.

When implementing the application:
- Pages **must not be visually empty**
- Add additional UI sections, widgets, cards, tables, placeholders, and sample content where appropriate
- Follow modern dashboard UI/UX practices
- Dummy data and placeholder content are allowed and encouraged
- If a page logically requires more content than explicitly listed, **add it**
- Empty states must include descriptive messages and actionable buttons
- The application should feel **production-like and complete**, not minimal

## 🚨 SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR CODE GENERATION (COPILOT CONTROL)

Copilot MUST assume this repository starts completely EMPTY.

Copilot MUST:
- Generate the complete backend project from scratch
- Create all required directories and files automatically
- Generate a Spring Boot backend project using Maven
- Create the full standard Spring Boot file structure
- Generate all configuration, source, and resource files
- Proceed without asking setup or clarification questions

Copilot MUST NOT:
- Ask the user to manually create files or folders
- Ask questions about environment or setup
- Pause implementation waiting for confirmation

## Database Instructions (Copilot-Controlled)

- A MySQL database named `productivity_hub` already exists on localhost
- Assume MySQL is running and accessible
- Do NOT generate SQL schema files or migration scripts
- Do NOT use Flyway or Liquibase
- Use Spring Boot with JPA/Hibernate exclusively
- Define all database tables using Java `@Entity` classes only
- Use Spring Data JPA repositories for data access
- Configure Hibernate to automatically create and update tables
- Use `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`
- Copilot MUST generate `application.properties` with MySQL configuration
- Do NOT include database creation or setup instructions

  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring Security
  - MySQL Driver
  - WebSocket
- Main Spring Boot application class
- Standard package structure:
  - controller
  - service
  - repository
  - model / entity
  - config
  - security
- `application.properties` configured for MySQL and JPA

---

## Suggested Project Structure

### Backend
controller/
service/
repository/
model/
dto/
config/
scheduler/
websocket/

### Frontend
components/
pages/
services/
hooks/
context/
utils/

---

## Development Guidelines

- Follow clean architecture principles
- Keep controllers thin
- Place business logic in services
- Use DTOs for API communication
- Use WebSockets only for real-time features
- Ensure all pages are visually complete
- Maintain readable and well-documented code

---

## Deployment & Run Instructions (Copilot-Controlled)

Copilot MUST generate code or scripts to allow the project to run locally and optionally in GitHub Codespaces.

Copilot MUST:
- Provide instructions or scripts to run backend and frontend automatically
- Configure backend to connect to MySQL on localhost
- Ensure JPA/Hibernate generates tables automatically on startup
- Allow optional H2 in-memory database for Codespaces / demo only
- Provide proper port configuration:
  - Backend: 8080
  - Frontend: 3000
- Generate `README_RUN.md` or `run_instructions.md` with clear run commands
- Include npm / yarn commands for frontend
- Include Maven commands for backend
- Include steps for switching between local MySQL and H2 for Codespaces
- Provide instructions to verify the project is running (open browser, sample URLs)

Copilot MUST NOT:
- Attempt to deploy to cloud automatically
- Generate complex infrastructure (AWS / Docker / Railway) unless explicitly asked
- Modify database creation assumptions (still relies on existing `productivity_hub` database)
